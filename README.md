CS 257 Final Project Phase 2

This project is an incredible adventure of a wayward blob, traveling through the dangers of intergalactic space. The Intergalactic Adventure of Blob is a helicopter-type game, that takes user input to keep the Blob away from the walls on the top and bottom of the screen.

In this phase of the project, the classes for the model, view, and controller have been created. The model classes and all their subclasses have been created with method stubs, commented in javadoc, and junit tests were created. Only non-trivial methods of these classes have had tests created for them
